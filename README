THE IANA /etc FILES PACKAGE


ABOUT

    The iana-etc package installs services(5) and protocols(5) using data from
    the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority <https://www.iana.org/>.  In future,
    other such files may be added.

    Included are snapshots of the data from the IANA, scripts to transform that
    data into the needed formats, and scripts to fetch the latest data.

    Thanks to Seth W. Klein for earlier versions of the package.

    Bug reports and patches are welcome.

DEPENDENCIES

    GNU Awk 3.1.0 or Later
	Numerous GNU Awk extensions are used.  Awk was chosen over Perl for
	its smaller size and more flexible installation process both of which
	are important in a bootstrap environment.

	Version 3.1.0 or later is required for support of the third argument
	to match().  The workaround to support older versions would be less
	readable and slower so I'd rather not include it without good reason.

	Like GNU Awk before 3.1.0, Mawk doesn't support three argument match()
	and so is not supported.  It also doesn't support network extensions.

    Make
	Testing is only done with GNU Make but incompatibilities with other
	make implementations are bugs. Please send patches.

    Perl (optional)
        Perl can be used to download the updated files from upstream. Suitable
        files are provided in the distribution.

INSTALLATION

    The installation process is flexible and friendly to unattended install-
    ation even though, due to its simplicity, it does not use Autoconf.

    For basic installation run:

	make
	su
	make install

    This creates /etc/services and /etc/protocols without using internet
    access.

    To install to a temporary location as package managers often do, use
    DESTDIR like this:

	make DESTDIR=/mnt/tmp install

    This will create /mnt/tmp/etc/services and /mnt/tmp/etc/protocols.

    PREFIX is also supported but currently does the same thing as DESTDIR.

    For unusual installations,

	make DESTDIR=/tmp PREFIX=/foo ETC_DIR=/bar install

    will create /tmp/foo/bar/services and /tmp/foo/bar/protocols.

GETTING FRESH DATA

    This process is not advised for unattended installations.  See below.
    To fetch the latest data from the IANA run:

	make get
	make
	make test
	# Visually inspect protocols and services because some errors
	# could produce a file that is valid but contains no records.

    Beware that while test checks for invalid lines in the output files,
    it cannot check for applications that might be broken by changes made
    by the IANA or breakage that makes the file valid but not useful.  In
    addition, there is generally little of interest in the IANA's changes
    unless you're trying to pick a port for new development in which case
    you're better off consulting the unfiltered files.
